# ELRS TX Module
## Compatible with every radio out there

I'm making this for my radio controller as the range on the built-in one is pretty low, It's compatible with crossfire/ELRS protocol and should be able to be used in every radio out there!

Let me know on what i can edit to make it better!
components:
- esp-wroon-32
